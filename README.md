# event manager

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Points for improvement

1. Custom styles for validation messages and error indicators
2. Email validation
3. Tests

## Diversion from the design

1. I removed the am/pm radio input to allow the time period to be selected in the html time input. Depending on system locale the input shows 12 or 24 hour format so the am/pm radio would be reduntant.
